# RAG in Groq-API-WITH-Llama3

##Overview
The Groq-API-WITH-Llama3 repository demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automated testing in maintenance applications. This project integrates the Groq API with Llama3, leveraging the power of large language models for efficient retrieval and response generation, specifically focused on scripts and test cases not readily available on the internet. The goal is to provide accurate, context-aware insights and responses to maintenance queries.

##Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines external knowledge sources with advanced AI tools to generate responses.
Groq API Integration: Uses Groq's hardware-accelerated capabilities for optimized AI inference.
Llama3 Integration: Llama3 model for natural language understanding and generation, improving the accuracy and relevance of responses.

##Project Structure
NewFunctioning__RAG.ipynb: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the functionality of RAG with Groq API and Llama3.
newfunctioning__rag.py: Python script for integrating Groq API with Llama3 for automated testing scenarios.
README.md: Project documentation.
##Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shristighimire/Groq-API-WITH-Llama3.git
cd Groq-API-WITH-Llama3
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you may install the dependencies manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install groq-api llama3

##Usage
Using the Jupyter Notebook
Open NewFunctioning__RAG.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook environment.
Run the cells to see how the RAG system interacts with the Groq API and Llama3 to generate responses for automated testing.
Using the Python Script
Run the Python script newfunctioning__rag.py for executing RAG functionalities:

bash
Copy code
python newfunctioning__rag.py
The script will use Groq API and Llama3 for test case generation and retrieval from an external knowledge source.
